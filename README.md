# React Projects

Welcome to the React Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of small React projects that I've created. Each project is designed to showcase different aspects of React development.

## Projects

1. **Password Generator**
   - Description: A simple password generator built using useCallback, useEffect and useRef hooks. It generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length, numbers and characters.

2. **Currency Converter**
   - Description: A basic currency converter application developed with React using custom hook. It allows users to convert between different currencies using real-time exchange rates.

3. **Todo List**
   - Description: A todo list application created using React's Context API and local storage for state management. It enables users to add, remove, update and mark tasks as completed.
